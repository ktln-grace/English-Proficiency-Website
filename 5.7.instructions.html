                <p>TOURISTS IN A FRAGILE LAND <br><br>

As a scientist working in Antarctica, I spend most of my time in the lab studying ice. I am trying to find out the age of
Antarctic ice. All we know for certain is that it is the oldest ice in the world. The more we understand it, the more we
will understand the changing weather of the Earth. Today, as with an increasing number of days, I had to leave my
work to greet a group of tourists who were taking a vacation in this continent of ice. And even though I can appreciate
their desire to experience this vast and beautiful landscape, I feel Antarctica should be closed to tourists.
Because Antarctica is the center of important scientific research, it must be preserved for this purpose.
Meteorologists are now looking at the effects of the ozone hole that was discovered above Antarctica in 1984. They
are also trying to understand global warming. If the Earth’s temperature continues to increase, the health and safety
of every living thing on the planet will be affected. Astronomers have a unique view of space and are able to see it
very clearly from Antarctica. Biologists have a chance to learn more about the animals that inhabit the coastal areas
of this frozen land. Botanists study the plant life to understand how it can live in such a harsh environment, and
geologists study the Earth to learn more about how it was formed. There are even psychologists who study how
people behave when they live and work together in such a remote location. <br> <br>
When tourist groups come here, they take us away from our research. Our work is difficult, and some of our projects
can be damaged by such simple mistakes as opening the wrong door or bumping into a small piece of equipment.
Tourists in Antarctica can also hurt the environment. Members of Greenpeace, one of the world’s leading
environmental organizations, complain that tourists leave trash on beaches and disturb the plants and animals. In a
place as frozen as Antarctica, it can take 100 years for a plant to grow back, and tourists can easily damage penguin
eggs. Oil spills are another problem caused by tourism. Oil spills not only kill penguins but can also destroy scientific
projects. <br> <br>
The need to protect Antarctica from tourists becomes even greater when we consider the fact that there is no
government here. Antarctica belongs to no country. Who is making sure that the penguins, plants, and sea are safe?
No one is responsible. In fact, we scientists are only temporary visitors ourselves. It is true that the number of tourists
who visit Antarctica each year is small compared to the number of those who visit other places. However, these other
places are inhabited by local residents and controlled by local governments. They have an interest in protecting their
natural environments. Who is concerned about the environment of Antarctica? The scientists, to be sure, but not
necessarily the tour companies that make money from sending people south. <br> <br>
If we don’t protect Antarctica from tourism, there may be serious consequences for us all. We might lose the results
of scientific research projects. It’s possible that these results could teach us something important about the causes
and effects of climate change. Some fragile plants and animals might die and disappear forever. This could damage
the balance of animal and plant life in Antarctica. We know from past experience that when things get unbalanced,
harmful changes can occur. Clearly, Antarctica should remain a place for careful and controlled scientific research.
We cannot allow tourism to bring possible danger to the planet. The only way to protect this fragile and important part
of the planet is to stop tourists from traveling to Antarctica.<b>Double-Check:</b> Finally, double-check that you're ready to begin the quiz. Once you click the "Start Quiz" button, the adventure begins!
