                    The victory of the small Greek democracy of Athens over the mighty Persian Empire in 490 B.C.
                    is one of the most famous events in history. Darius, king of the Persian Empire, was furious
                    because Athens had interceded for the other Greek city-states in revolt against Persian
                    domination. In anger the king sent an enormous army to defeat Athens. He thought it would take
                    drastic steps to pacify the rebellious part of the empire.
                    <br> <br> Persia was ruled by one man. In Athens, however, all citizens helped to rule. Ennobled by this
                    participation, Athenians were prepared to die for their city-state. Perhaps this was the secret of
                    the remarkable victory at Marathon, which freed them from Persian rule. On their way to
                    Marathon, the Persians tried to fool some Greek city-states by claiming to have come in peace.
                    The frightened citizens of Delos refused to believe this. Not wanting to abet the conquest of
                    Greece, they fled from their city and did not return until the Persians had left. They were wise,
                    for the Persians next conquered the city of Eritrea and captured its people.
                    <br> <br>Tiny Athens stood alone against Persia. The Athenian people went to their sanctuaries. There
                    they prayed for deliverance. They asked their gods to expedite their victory. The Athenians
                    refurbished their weapons and moved to the plain of Marathon, where their little band would
                    meet the Persians. At the last moment, soldiers from Plataea reinforced the Athenian troops.
                    The Athenian army attacked, and Greek citizens fought bravely. The power of the mighty
                    Persians was offset by the love that the Athenians had for their city. Athenians defeated the
                    Persians in both archery and hand combat. Greek soldiers seized Persian ships and burned
                    them, and the Persians fled in terror. Herodotus, a famous historian, reports that 6,400 Persians
                    died, compared to only 192 Athenians.
